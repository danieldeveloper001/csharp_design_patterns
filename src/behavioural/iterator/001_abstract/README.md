# The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **iterator design pattern** to demonstrate how the **iterator** serve the
purpose of handling navigation logic for a collection of elements stored at the **iterable** by using a bidirectional
navigation iterator. In addition to that, methods for directly accessing the first and last element of the collection
are provided to demonstrate that an iterator can have direct access to elements without affecting the current iteration
state.
