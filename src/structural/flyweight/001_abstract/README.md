# The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **flyweight design pattern** to demonstrate how the **concrete flyweight**
instances can be created by the **flyweight factory** and managed within its object instance cache, so that they are
created only once and on demand during the application lifecycle and can be consumed by a **client**.
