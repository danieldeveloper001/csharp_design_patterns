## Structural

### Adapter

[Adapter][adapter] allows clients to interact with internal or external existing code bases that are incompatible with
the current implementation and cannot be changed, through a thin layer whose solely responsibility is handling the
adaptation process.

### Composite

[Composite][composite] allows clients to consume hierarchical object structures uniformly, making no distinction between
different node types, through a contract implemented by any element at any hierarchical level.

### Facade

[Facade][facade] allows clients to interact with contracts that are redesigned either to organize existing large
contracts into smaller and cohese ones or to aggregate functionality from multiple subsystems in order to group related
functionality.

### Flyweight

[Flyweight][flyweight] allows multiple object instances to share intrinsic state while still being able to handle
extrinsic state in its operations through an on demand cache for optimized compute resource usage.

### Proxy

[Proxy][proxy] adds a layer of access control functionality between clients and existing services in a way that clients
are unaware of which one is being consumed.
