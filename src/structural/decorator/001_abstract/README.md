## The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **decorator design pattern** in order to demonstrate how to this design
pattern is structured. In this example, the **client** invokes both the **undecorated component** and **decorated
component** in order to show the differences between their behaviours. The former, executes solely its own operation.
The latter, wraps the call to the component and performs actions before and after.
