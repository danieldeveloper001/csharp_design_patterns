# The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **factory method design pattern** to demonstrate how the **abstract creators**
serve the purpose of specifying a contract by using an **abstract product** so that **concrete creators** can create
**concrete products**. In addition to that, a sample action is provided and invoked at the **client**, that is decoupled
from the concrete products themselves, as though from their creation logic.
