# The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **builder design pattern** to demonstrate how to abstract object creation from representation by using **concrete builders** that implements the contract from an **abstract builder** whose creation
steps are invoked by a **director**, responsible for making these steps reusable to one or more **clients** in the
application that request for a **product** instance.
