# The Abstract Example With Fluent Api

**The Abstract Example With Fluent Api** makes use of the **builder design pattern** to demonstrate a possible approach
to implement step by step creation of existing complex products with a fluent api. In this example, the product builder
stores data from each invoked step, so that on the build method the constructor parameters can be fullfilled.
