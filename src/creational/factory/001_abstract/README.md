# The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **abstract factory design pattern** to demonstrate how an **abstract factory**
provides a contract that once fullfilled by **concrete factories** can be used to create multiple related **products**.
In this example, the related products has the same suffix, meaning that...

- **Factory1** is responsible for creating related **ProductA1**, **ProductB1** and **ProductC1**
- **Factory2** is responsible for creating related **ProductA2**, **ProductB2** and **ProductC2**
- **Factory3** is responsible for creating related **ProductA3**, **ProductB3** and **ProductC3**
