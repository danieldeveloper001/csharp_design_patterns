## The Abstract Shallow Copy Example

**The Abstract Shallow Copy Example** makes use of the **prototype design pattern** in order to demonstrate how to
create new objects from a prototype using the **shallow copy** approach. In shallow copies,

- Value Types values are copied, meaning that changes to the original object values doesn't affect clones.
- Reference Types addresses are copied, meaning that changes to the original object values do affect clones.
