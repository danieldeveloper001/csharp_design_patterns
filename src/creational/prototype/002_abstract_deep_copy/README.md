## The Abstract Deep Copy Example

**The Abstract Deep Copy Example** makes use of the **prototype design pattern** in order to demonstrate how to
create new objects from a prototype using the **deep copy** approach. In shallow copies,

- Value Types values are copied, meaning that changes to the original object values doesn't affect clones.
- Reference Types values are copied, meaning that changes to the original object values doesn't affect clones.
