# Factory Method

**Factory Method** is a **creational design pattern** whose goal is to hide instatiation logic by defining a
parametrized common interface for creating different types of objects. In order to achieve such goal, the factory method
delegates the object creation responsibility to the subclasses that implements this contract.
