## The Eagerly Loaded Singleton Example

**The Eagerly Loaded Singleton Example** makes use of the **singleton design pattern** in order to demonstrate how to
manage the creation of a single instance of an object by using the eager loading approach, which creates the object at
the moment the application is loaded. This approach may have performance impact on the application startup if many
singletons are used.
