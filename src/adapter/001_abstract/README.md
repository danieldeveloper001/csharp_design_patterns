## The Abstract Example

**The Abstract Example** makes use of the **adapter design pattern** in order to demonstrate how to this design pattern
is structured. In this example, the **client** invokes both the **adaptee** and **adapter** and the results are the same
after the adaptation process, since in the adaptation process no functionality must be added.
