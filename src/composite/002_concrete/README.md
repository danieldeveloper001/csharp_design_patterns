## The Sales Report Example

**The Sales Report Example** makes use of the **composite design pattern** in order to demonstrate how to create a
sales report hierarchical structure that can any of a **yearly report**, a **monthly report**, a single **sale report**
or even a **quinquennial report** (not implemented, but could be easily added as a new root node containing multiple
yearly reports added as children of such report).
