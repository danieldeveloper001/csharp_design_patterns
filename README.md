# C# Design Patterns

Design patterns are language independent conceptual solutions that aims to provide reusable responses to recurrent
problems in software development in order to achieve solutions that are clean, extensible and easier to maintain.

**What design patterns are and when should them be used?**

:construction: This section is under construction
- **Design patterns are conceptual solutions for known problems**, meaning that they provide a guideline on how to
  handle such problems in a clean and reusable fashion.
- **Design patterns are tools**, meaning that there are intended use cases and some of them will be best suited for
  a specific job than others.

**What design patterns aren't and when shouldn't be used?**

:construction: This section is under construction
- **Design patterns aren't an implementation**, meaning that they should be adapted to the problem at hand and not the
  other way around.
- **Design patterns aren't a goal**, meaning that they should be implemented to resolve a software design problem and
  not the other way around.
