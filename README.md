# C# Design Patterns

Design patterns are language independent conceptual solutions that aims to provide reusable responses to recurrent
problems in software development in order to achieve solutions that are clean, extensible and easier to maintain. In
this repository, the language of choice for demonstrating them is C#.

**What design patterns are and when should them be used?**

- **Design patterns are conceptual solutions for known problems**, meaning that they provide a guideline on how to
  handle such problems in a clean and reusable fashion.
- **Design patterns are language independent**, meaning that there is no right or wrong language of choice for applying
  their concepts and that actual implementations may vary and benefit from language specific features.
- **Design patterns are tools**, meaning that there are intended use cases and some of them will be best suited for
  a specific job than others.

**What design patterns aren't and when shouldn't be used?**

- **Design patterns aren't an implementation**, meaning that they should be adapted to the problem at hand and not the
  other way around.
- **Design patterns aren't a silver bullet**, meaning that resolving simple problems with simple solutions is a suitable
  approach, they should be used to resolve problems that are complex enough to benefit from their usage.
- **Design patterns aren't a goal**, meaning that they should be implemented to resolve a software design problem and
  not the other way around.
